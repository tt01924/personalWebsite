                <p>Wess Vex. A creative endevour by Dexter Vex to share passions and creations here, today.<br>
                    Wess Vex grows to embody city culture; the abstract beauty of being one lost amongst millions that eat, sleep, and breath around you. A brand for those who prefer the un-aesthetic, that enjoy the muck and dirt of the city imperfection which hums. A provider of quality and stylistic streetwear for the ones who deserve to enjoy it and should.<br>
                    Raised on a Northern English farm to festering in Amsterdam; we're certainly not from Paris madame.<br>
                    Founded in 2021 so you can find Wess Vex now and long into the future.</p>
