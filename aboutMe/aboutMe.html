        <h2>Why I would like to move into a career as a web developer.</h2>
            <p>Hey!</p>
            <p>My name is Todd Taylor, and after my stream of questions on Discord or at the Finsbury Park meet-ups, I’m excited to be applying for your March cohort. </p>
            <p>A short intro on who I am: I grew up in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, before studying at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland and the Vrij Universiteit, The Netherlands for my joint honours MA degree in Economics and Politics. After graduating last summer, I moved to London where I began working in May 2023 as a financial consultant and recruiter. I left this role earlier this year, as I’ve come to realise the career I want to pursue. </p>
            <p>Throughout my university studies I became Saltire Scholar who lived and studied abroad in Amsterdam and reached a professional literacy in French. I have always been a motivated and curious person, I thrive off of challenges and problem-solving, and that’s what has led me to Founders & Coders. At heart I am a conscientious and productive individual who strives to engage in opportunities which benefit my career, health, and moral compass. </p>
            <p>During my time of reflection after leaving my previous role, I decided to ask people who worked in fields that interested me about their skills and career backgrounds. Their common stepping stone: 
            they were all computationally literate. This sparked my interest in coding; the ethos of limitless learning and development fully adheres to me and was a perfect place to feed my curiosity, as well as my passions. From puzzles to learning Javascript, I have always loved tasks that require solution-finding and a more analytical approach. I like to attack new challenges head on and within the computer science industry I believe I would be a strong fit in that regard as well.
            </p>
            <p>I chose Founders and Coders as the conduit I wish to learn through as the peer-led help and learning process aligns with the style of learning I work best with. Founders and Coders take pride to ensure their candidates fit the bill of being critical thinkers, devoted to a more equitable and diverse future within the tech industry, and an openness to learning and change.</p>
            <p>These factors I resonate strongly with and why I am applying to join the Founders and Coders program in oppose to another. I hope you can see from my website, game, background, and current interests that I am a logical and systematic thinker who has a passion for learning and creative construction, making me a great fit within your program. </p>
            <p>I look forward to your feedback and hope you take me into consideration.</p>
            <p>Best,</p>
            <p>Todd</p>
